We study metabolism. Our lab in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the [University of New Mexico Medical School](https://hsc.unm.edu/research/) investigates how metabolic networks support the health of living organisms. Our research focuses on the fundamental principles that guide interactions between metabolic pathways.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We are intrigued by the intricate connections of central metabolic pathways. Why are they built this way? How does their function affect organismal physiology? To understand the logic behind the architecture of the metabolic network, we use the renowned model organism, the nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_, along with its bacterial diet. Metabolomics and genetics are our favorite tools.
