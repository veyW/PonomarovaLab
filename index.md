# PONOMAROVA LAB

The Ponomarova Lab at the [University of New Mexico Medical School](https://hsc.unm.edu/research/)'s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology investigates how metabolism contributes to the health of living organisms. Our research focuses on the fundamental principles of central metabolism. We are particularly interested in identifying 'pressure points' that drive the transition between health and illness.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We study central metabolic pathways. How are they connected? What does it mean for organismal physiology? To understand the logic behind the metabolic network architecture we use a renowned model organism nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its bacterial diet. Metabolomics and genetics are our favorite tools.
