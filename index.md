We study metabolism. Our lab at the [University of New Mexico Medical School](https://hsc.unm.edu/research/)'s Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology investigates how metabolic network supports health of living organisms. Our research focuses on the fundamental principles that guide metabolic pathways interactions.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We are intrigued by intericate connections of central metabolic pathways. Why are they built this way? How does their function affect organismal physiology? To understand the logic behind the metabolic network architecture we use a renowned model organism nematode _Caenorhabditis elegans_ and its bacterial diet. Metabolomics and genetics are our favorite tools.
