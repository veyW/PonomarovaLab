I enjoy experimenting with C. elegans from a new perspective by concentrating on carbon metabolism. In addition to doing science, I am interested in reading, listening to, and occasionally composing short tales. I also enjoy drawing pencil and oil pastel sketches.  

Well, you can shortly call me ?Bharathi?.
