I am a senior studying Biochemistry and Women, Gender, and Sexuality studies at UNM. I am in the process of completing an honors thesis for the Biochemistry department where I hope to learn more about a specific enzyme and its effect on metabolism. I was born and raised in NM, and I prefer red chile over green. I have a teacup yorkie, Nico, who I love very much! I love to watch boxing and softball, eat huevos rancheros, and listen to music!
